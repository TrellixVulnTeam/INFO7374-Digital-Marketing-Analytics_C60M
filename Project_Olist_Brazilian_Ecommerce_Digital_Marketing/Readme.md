4. Predicting the Customer Lifetime Value
5. Created a personalized Recommendations System 
6. Created business dashboards for the stakeholders
7. Created an AWS Data Pipeline to monitor the dataset
8. Created two separate applications, one from customer perspective which is  Recommender System App using React app framework and other is for Digital marketing Personas which is a Dash Application
9. React Application was deployed on Firebase whereas Dash Application was deployed on Heroku
